description: 'Arca Verborum provides denormalized, analysis-ready comparative wordlist
  data

  from 149 Lexibank datasets, containing over 2.9 million lexical forms. The data

  has been aggregated, harmonized, and structured for immediate use in computational

  historical linguistics research and education.


  This dataset addresses accessibility challenges in working with CLDF-formatted

  data by providing pre-joined metadata, aggregated cognate judgments, and global

  unique identifiers. It is designed for rapid method development, student projects,

  and exploratory analysis while preserving all essential linguistic information.


  Key features:

  - Single CSV files with denormalized metadata

  - Aggregated cognate judgments from 81 datasets

  - Glottolog and Concepticon integration

  - Comprehensive bibliographic references

  - Quality validation reports

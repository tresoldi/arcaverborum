title: 'Arca Verborum: A Global Lexical Database for Computational Historical Linguistics'
version: A.20251008
upload_type: dataset
description: |
  Arca Verborum is a multi-source lexical database for computational historical linguistics. Series A provides analysis-ready comparative wordlist data from 149 Lexibank datasets (List et al., 2022), containing over 2.9 million lexical forms across 9,700+ languages.

  While CLDF's normalized structure is excellent for data integrity, it requires significant preprocessing before analysis. Series A provides denormalized, pre-joined CSV files for immediate use in research and education.

  This release includes three collections: Full (all 149 datasets), Core (13 curated datasets for teaching), and CoreCog (58 datasets with expert cognate judgments).

  **Citation:** If you use this dataset, you must cite both Arca Verborum and the Lexibank project (List et al., 2022, DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01432-0). See DATASET_DESCRIPTION.md in the archive for complete citation information.

  Key features:
  - Denormalized CSV files with pre-joined metadata
  - 95% Glottolog coverage, 85% Concepticon coverage
  - Aggregated cognate judgments from 81 datasets
  - Comprehensive bibliographic references
  - Quality validation reports
